          <h1>September 18, 2023 </h1>
          <p>Hello! <br> This is my first entry ever! Today I had Spanish class and a class called The Arab World and The West. I am hoping my study abroad advisor responds to me soon about my classes. I am trying to get a new course approved for a course at SU, so more courses I am taking abroad will count for something. <br><br> Edit: I got the course approved for another UCOR course, so now I am taking two courses that count for UCOR courses. That frees up my schedule for when I return to SU to be able to take more CS electives. I have already been looking at them and some of them look like they would be fun to take.<br><br>The food today for dinner was the best we've had so far. We had this really yummy pasta with garlic and cheese. I am definitely missing my spice though!</p>
