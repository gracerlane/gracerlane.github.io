				<p>Introduction to programming and computing fundamentals, with emphasis on problem solving, design and style.
					Prior programming experience is not required. This course introduces fundamental programming concepts such as
					functional decomposition, stepwise refinement, control structures, loops, functions, primitive and aggregate
					data types.</p>

				<h2>Programming and Problem Solving II</h2>
				<p>Continuation of programming and problem solving, including abstract data types (ADTs), dynamic memory, linked
					lists, stacks, queues, and testing.</p>

				<h2>Data Structures</h2>
				<p>Fundamental data structures including binary search trees, priority queues, hash tables, and heaps. Abstract
					data type implementation and design. Code analysis using big-O notation, recursion, and sorting algorithms.
				</p>

				<h2>Foundations of Computer Science</h2>
				<p>Introduction to logic, applications of logic, methods of proof , sets, functions, induction, recurrence
					relations, graphs, and counting.</p>

				<h2>Fundamentals of Databases</h2>
				<p>Fundamental concepts of database design and applications, including relational database design,
					entity-relationship (ER) model, standard query language (SQL), transaction management, and triggers. Design
					and development of applications using databases.</p>

				<h2>Languages and Computation</h2>
				<p>Common features, organization and tradeoffs of modern programming languages including types, binding, and
					memory management. Theoretical foundations of languages and computation including regular expressions,
					language classification, grammars, and finite state automata. Functional style programming including
					higher-order functions and closures.</p>

				<h2>The Art of Web Design</h2>
				<p>An introduction to website design with emphasis on the area of human computer interaction (HCI). Topics
